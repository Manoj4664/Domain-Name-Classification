🕵️‍♂️ Domain Name Classification (DGA Detection)

This repository contains a Domain Name Classification Model designed to detect malicious domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). Such domains are often used by attackers for botnets, phishing, and malware distribution. By leveraging Machine Learning and advanced linguistic/statistical features, this model distinguishes between benign and DGA-generated domains.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that:

Extracts linguistic and statistical features from domain names.

Trains classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to separate benign from malicious domains.

Provides a scalable detection system for cybersecurity applications.

📊 Features Extracted

The model computes a rich set of features for each domain, including:

Length-based Features: Domain length, digit count, hyphen count, unique characters.

Linguistic Features: Vowel/Consonant ratio, pronounceability, dictionary word ratio.

Statistical Features:

Shannon Entropy

Character Gini Index

KL Divergence (character distribution vs. natural language)

Compression Ratio

Lexical Complexity

N-gram Language Model Features: Bigram & Trigram scores.

Repetition Patterns: Consecutive digits/characters.

TLD Analysis: TLD reputation & frequency.
